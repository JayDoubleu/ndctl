# NAME

ndctl-update-firmware - update the firmware the given device

# SYNOPSIS

>     ndctl update-firmware <dimm> [<options>]

# DESCRIPTION

Provide a generic interface for updating NVDIMM firmware. The use of
this depends on support for the NVDIMM "family" in libndctl, the kernel
needs to enable that command set, and the device itself needs to
implement the command. Use "ndctl list -DF" to interrogate if firmware
update is enabled. For example:

>     ndctl list -DFu -d nmem1
>     {
>       "dev":"nmem1",
>       "id":"cdab-0a-07e0-ffffffff",
>       "handle":"0",
>       "phys_id":"0",
>       "security":"disabled",
>       "firmware":{
>         "current_version":"0",
>         "can_update":true
>       }
>     }

# OPTIONS

\<dimm>  
A *nmemX* device name, or a dimm id number. Restrict the operation to
the specified dimm(s). The keyword *all* can be specified to indicate
the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not supplying a
--dimm option at all.

`-b; --bus=`  
A bus id number, or a provider string (e.g. "ACPI.NFIT"). Restrict the
operation to the specified bus(es). The keyword *all* can be specified
to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a --bus option at all.

`-f; --firmware`  
firmware file used to perform the update

`-i; --force`  
Ignore in-progress Address Range Scrub and try to submit the firmware
update, or ignore firmware activate arm overflows and force-arm devices.

`-A; --arm`  
Arm a device for firmware activation. This is enabled by default when a
firmware image is specified. Specify --no-arm to disable this default.
Otherwise, without a firmware image, this option can be used to manually
arm a device for firmware activate.

`-D; --disarm`  
Disarm devices after uploading the firmware file, or manually disarm
devices when a firmware image is not specified. --no-disarm is not
accepted.

`-v; --verbose`  
Emit debug messages for the namespace check process.
